its coming faster than we thought. 

in this exact moment society may have access to a superinellegence running on a desktop computer. 

OpenAI has released their benchmarks for their newest model, o3. and people kinda lost their shit. 

For one it hit 87.5% on the [ARC-AGI benchmark](https://arcprize.org) with a high compute setting ( spending nearly ~ $20000/task ). Plus extremley impressive scores on the [frontier math benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04872) ( [see this post for the whole story]( "https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1870186518230511844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw") )


now model benchmarks are cool, they're fantastic to grab attention ( and extesstential dread from certain parts of the dev community )

but how does o3 give the guarantee of abundance, infinite knowledge, spreading extropically througout the galaxy to preserve intellegent life

the truth is nobody really knows, but its sure as hell good fun to speculate

### scenario one: its good, but its not *that* good


### scenario two: its really good and its getting better quickly


### scenario three: its so good that its kept top secret and not released to the public for fear of revolt and sweeping change of the network state.
