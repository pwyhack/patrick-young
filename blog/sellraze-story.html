        <p>America has battled with China in a long, consuming struggle. Currently, it feels like we are losing. So, I'll tell you a story about how I lost absolutely everything in the span of a month: my startup, my life, my mind, myself.</p>
        <p>This is some serious dad lore, so if you can't handle this right now, click off.</p>
        <p>Let's start with a hypothetical scenario. We have Person U and Person C; both are equity holders in a company.</p>
        <p>For the sake of argument, let's say Person U is a Type 0 D. This person loves his country, loves grinding, and loves all things startups. He kisses the earth beneath Paul Graham's feet.</p>
        <p>One day, the equilibrium shattered. A dispute over intellectual property rights emerged, pitting U against C in a battle that would test their resolve and the very foundation of their partnership.</p>
        <p>U, ever the patriot, believed in open-source innovation, sharing ideas to propel humanity forward. C, on the other hand, saw value in exclusivity, in securing patents and maximizing profits.</p>
        <p>Their conflict escalated, drawing in the entire team. Lines were drawn, and the startup's once bright future dimmed under the cloud of litigation and mistrust.</p>
        <p>In the end, the battle left no victors, only casualties. U lost his stake in the company, his dreams, and nearly his sanity. But it was in this crucible of defeat that he found a new purpose.</p>
        <p>He realized that true innovation cannot be chained by greed or national pride. It thrives in collaboration, in the free exchange of ideas, and in the relentless pursuit of a better tomorrow.</p>
        <p>So, he started anew, with a vision clearer than ever before. This time, not just to build a company, but to ignite a movement. A movement towards open innovation, towards a future where technology serves all of humanity, not just the privileged few.</p>
        <p>And thus, the phoenix rose from the ashes of SellRaze, promising a dawn filled with light, hope, and endless possibilities.</p>
