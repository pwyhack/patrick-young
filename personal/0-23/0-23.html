            <p>its been a hell of a year. AI is fucking ripping, meme coins hitiing billion with a B dollar marketcaps in a matter of days
            top ai leaders are projecting AGI is coming within the next 1-3 years. and jensen huang, what a fucking chad. 
            This essay is really about none of those things, its just the current thing that i'm now dealing with as a 23 year old, fresh off of a brutal cofounder breakup
            back into a brutal semester of georgia techism; yet I feel wofeully optomistic about what's to come.</p>

            <p>    this essay is really supposed to be a reflection on how the fuck we ( I ) got here. 

            Classically speaking we all know and understand how the fuck we got here, but more metaphsyically speaking, I think we all know deep down that we are all just a bunch of atoms in a computer.

            My first interaction with a computer was probably when I was 6 years old. My dad had a dell desktop computer, airgapped from the internet. I would play solitaire and mindsweeper on it. One day 
            he hooked it up to the internet, and we found a photo of a cat with a cyclops looking eye, my first encounter with disinformation or at the time just called internet hoaxes. 

            the internet back then was truly a simple thing, nobody really understood what the implications were yet everyone was enthralled with the concept of connection. 

            fast forward to
