distill these into a bulleted list of key acomplishments I had while at sellraze, ignore the ugly stuff, timestamp it: Kenneth, 

Regarding our phone conversation: here are some documents relevant to the situation

I have attached a google takeout of email data, I have relevant screenshots to contributions in text if need be, also the letter of termination that was sent to me today. 

Its all here in this google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13bN1yMFjZF1Bk3IglcrgrjdhVBrK7iQX?usp=sharing

the relevant context is this: 

I joined SellRaze on the 11th of July 2023, see NDA/Invention Agreement/Employee Contract?. This was a few days after the company had been officially formed. I was offered an equity plan in august & officially signed an ESOP for 10% on Aug 29th. I accepted as, at the time it was early in the company and I had only been there for a bit, they also offered to call me a cofounder & I agreed happily.  

What happens next: 


( July-September 2023 )  I set up the backbone of our company's business infrastructure for our product at the time, registered us in GA as a foreign entity, helped smooth the transition into a Delaware C corp, and made sure to get our accounting/HR/Payroll software set up. Ran majority of our GTM strategy and direct sales with Discord webhook marketing ( I created every webhook message, would sometimes take jeff days to approve a message. I attempted to get us set up with meta ads but once again jeff would take days to approve creatives when it shouldve never needed to be approved, I shouldve had autonomy here which I argued for several times through inperson conversations ) 

( Early Oct 2023 ). I came up with the idea for what has now turned into our mobile app on ( October 13th 2023 see ), which was then not put into motion until the end of the year ( note development of this started in dec 23, then jeff halted it for some reason, not sure why, then restarted this in january )

( Mid-End October 2023 ) I took our company through a program called Zfellows that got us a 10k check from Cory Levy, planned a whole trip to the bay, booked all our flights, luggage, everything.  ( my application was what got us an interview in the first place I belive I was the first to submit and then baylor adams reached out to me and asked for Jeff & Tyler to make applications, I also encouraged us to reapply for YC and wrote the majority of the application based off a past application ) 

( Early November 2023 )  I raised capital for our company, over 500k dollars, I set up all the investor meetings, handled most of the relations etc. ( started this mid novemeber and wrapped up in december, note jeff’s inability to make decisions slowed this process down 3 weeks ). Jeff and Tyler contributed to this but honestly it slowed us down more than anything due to the elongated decesion making process that jeff underwent every time, inability to execute and make decisions as CEO, said he was being frugal/logical but I chalk it up to inexperience and he didn’t even try to learn about raising money/vc/buiding investor relationships even when I offered. would get ignored alot on this ) 

( End of November - Early December 2023 ): I sourced a developer to build our mobile app, I found a really good one, conducted the interviews, set him up 
    - Jeff put a hold on it ( mainly due to inability to execute on decisions fast enough ) 
    - Mobile app was put on pause

( Mid December 2023 ): jeff & I had a conversation about working harder, he told me he was burnt out, I told him fundamentally I dont believe in burnout ( context: this was during diabetic keto acidosis where I was still putting in the most hours, trying to move the needle along for the company, setting up hubspot infastructr for email markeiting. After this conversation I realized I was burnt out, but not becuase of work, just medical reasons ) note: this conversation is awknoledged by jeff in our meeting on the 27th of Feb 2024 in the recording I have attached.

( December 28th 2023 ):  I was then diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis, I did everything above while in the most life threatening, scary, unbelievably dark time of my life. I was diagnosed at scrips medical center in sandiego and the team came to colorado ( Occured from Oct-Dec 28th )

( Jan 7-14th 2024 ): Team comes to my home in Glenwood Springs, Colorado to kick off the year ( I also planned this trip before diabetes diagnosis ) Jeff agrees we need to build mobile, and do it fast, he reactivated the same developer with promise to manage him closely. 
    - Mobile app launch & development begins 

( Context: Month of Jan 2024 ): We spend January 2024 preparing for a huge product revival, I'm updating design, trying to help with dev's, mainly im focused on sourcing UGC creators and dev talent to push the company along & build a growth engine. To be honest January is blanking me bc I slept so little trying to get this company where it needed to be. I brought in a google ads person to run ads to drive traffic to our new landing page, I sourced VA's and other contractors to make content, spent my time planning, ideating on growth strategies etc. 

( End of Jan 2024 ): Towards the end of the month I approached Jeff and asked him for a more equal equity split given my prior contributions listed above. We agreed verbally within the team to rebalance to 30-30-40. 
30%  Me 30% Tyler 40% Jeff 

( Jan-Febuary 2024 ): This equity split was then put into motion by an accounting firm Aprio, ( Jeff denied me the right to bring them on for accounting and cap table help, for tax efficiency, in favor of a cheaper, inexperienced ( in startup taxes ) ) This equity split was also put into motion with our company Lawyer John lanza through email & a call. No contract was drafted or signed yet

( Mid Febuary 2024 ): I pull the contractor's code onto my laptop to see what the progress looks like. Its towards the beginning of feb ( don't have exact date when this occurred bc they locked me out of github ) This was one week out from a product launch, the code was nowhere near ready, everything was messy and a pile of shit to be honest, this threw us into a frenzy since I had setup an entire go to market strategy that only needed an app to launch. 

( Context: Overall) Throughout his time as CEO Jeff has had a repeated & documented history of being the last one in the office, the first one to leave, with excessively long lunch breaks ( longest was almost 3hr ). He also entered a new relationship towards the end of 2023, and his girlfriend would come into the office every day, a constant distraction. My cofounder Tyler and I pressed him about this continously and he did fix this behavior, he has admitted to this behavior in texts, conversations with 3rd parties, etc. 

( Context: Febuary 19th 2024 ): I am named publicly as a cofounder and a massive contributor to the success of the company publicly ( see georgia tech daily digest ) link: https://oue.gatech.edu/node/2999?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Full%20Story%0A&utm_campaign=Daily%20Digest%20-%20Feb.%2026%2C%202024

( Night of Tuesday Febuary 27th 2024 ): I had been scared to approach Jeff with all these concerns due to my 10% stake in the company and, in my own head his world model of building a startup was fundamentally flawed and he was unfit to man the helm of a * 5M * startup as the CEO. So I brought all my concerns to tyler ( other co founder ) after jeff left the office at 9PM where we had missed several developement deadlines that * should have * been hit at the beginning of Febuary I told tyler all of my concerns. I also was informed by tyler that jeff was planning to negotiate my equity split down from the agreed upon 30%, to me a sign of disrespect, violation of core values, and dishonest business dealings. I spent the next 5 hours preparing a strategy & plan to bring an offer to the table at morning meeting. 

( Morning of Wedensday Febuary 28th 2024 ): A meeting is set, jeff and tyler arrive into the office around 10AM or so. 
Due to georgias one party consent laws, I consented to recording the meeting that Jeff & Tyler were and most likley still are unaware of. See attached google drive containing relevant documents to this. High level, I adressed concerns, made them aware that I was there to listen with love, honesty & openness. Jeff explicitly states the only reason for a lower equity split is that tyler has been with the company longer ( C corp official formation June 20th 2023, I join 21 days after, C corp was transitioned from a Georgia LLC founded in 2021 ). I lay out all my concerns, address all of jeffs concerns, and propose a deal, 66% of the 30% shares I was promised to be vested upon completion of a 2 week GTM strategy and a growth engine built out alongide me offboarding and dumping all my knowledge into the company in the form of documentation & growth strategies. ( I gave them until 12PM Feb 29th to make a decision ) 

( Immediatly after meeting ): I am locked out of all compnay accounts. I call jeff and introduce more information into his decision matrix being that I had indexed and stored all relevant documnets, texts etc highligting my contribuitions to the company. I gave him until 12:46PM on the 29th of Febuary 2024 to send me, in writing 100% accelerated vesting of the 30% of shares I was owed. I was then subsequently removed from all social media accounts, removed and untagged as a collaborater on our instagram post annoucning our pre seed raise. I sent an email requesitng notice of termination based upon these events from my personal gmail account. 

( March 1st 2024 ): I recieive offical termination letter and demands to return all company documentation, transfer ownership of developer account ( apple ) & return a monitor, a monitor stand to the company. I am reminded of my invention assignment agreement which includes a section outlining trade secrets company information and our at will agreement. 

Now: I am reaching out to determine 
- The feasibilty of a wrongful termination case based upon retaliation 
- The ability to potentially resolve this in good faith and come to a settlment that will accelerate vesting of some amount of equity 
- If I should even spend the energy fighting this
It was my idea, my vision & for all intents and purposes I was acting as CEO of this compnay from the moment I joined. I have an interest in seeing this company succeed and will not attack the character of either Tyler or Jeff, publicly or privatly. More than happy to jump on a call, all relevant documentation is linked in this google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13bN1yMFjZF1Bk3IglcrgrjdhVBrK7iQX?usp=sharing
