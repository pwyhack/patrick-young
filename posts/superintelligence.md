Try to remember your first existential crisis. Seriously, look back and think about the first time you had any inkling of existential thought.

The memory remains vivid, a feeling that still resonates today. Standing in my parents' garage in Denver, Colorado at age 7, something shifted. It was 2007, before the GFC, when life was freaking good. For some reason I decided to look at my hands, as I looked at them my field of vision kept zooming out, more and more until it felt like I had 70 FOV on Fortnite. I kept thinking, "what am I", "why am I here", "what is this?" over, and over, and over. It was so dizzying, enthralling and hopeless. Safe to say my 7-year-old brain was thrown into a tailspin that I have *yet* to exit to this day.

That night, I vividly remember not being able to sleep because the stars out my window were so bright, it felt like the galaxy was beckoning me, calling my name.

Between that first existential expression and now, things have changed - to say the least. That childhood wonder has evolved into something more urgent, more purposeful. Sixteen years of pure acceleration puts us on the cusp of something great, or something that deserves to be great.

I believe that 2025 will open up the next great theatre of exploration, or at least when we look back in 30 years from our vacation planet in the Andromeda galaxy, we will recognize it as such.

Why? Superintelligence.

But this essay isn't about superintelligence, it's about us - the zoomers. That feeling of suppression, demotivation, and uninterest in the world around us masks something deeper. Behind our screens lies the same wonder that kept our ancestors mapping stars and dreaming of flight.

Look up at the sky on a clear night. When you see the twinkle of a trillion trillion unknowns softly beckoning, doesn't it ignite something in you? Doesn't it fill you with frustration to be grounded, held back by 9.8 m/sÂ² (and other gravitational constants that challenge our dreams of FTL travel)?

The stars are calling. That same existential ache you felt as a child staring at your hands, wondering what it all means - it wasn't despair. It was your first glimpse of the infinite. That feeling hasn't gone away. It's been waiting.

We grew up in a world that taught us to look down at screens instead of up at stars. But something is shifting. The tools to augment our minds, to explore the deepest mysteries of physics, to chart paths through spacetime - they're emerging in ways no one expected. Not locked away in institutions, but open to anyone brave enough to reach for them.

The children who once yearned for the stars are coming of age. And the stars haven't stopped calling.
